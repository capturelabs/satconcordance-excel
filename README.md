Example VLOOKUP recodes in Excel to concord new and old SAT values

## Overview
This repository contains an Excel workbook with a series of tabs that provide usage examples for recoding SAT® and ACT® values. Each tab is named either for the specific transformation that is offered or for the raw concordance table from the College Board. The first half of the worksheet tabs that offer the transformations provide two columns of data. The first column contains a set of initial values that need to be recoded. The second column contains the recoded values. The recoded values are obtained by using VLOOKUP statements that search the appropriate raw concordance table for the starting and ending value.
